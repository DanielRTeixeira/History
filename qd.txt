I am a 27 year old Autistic girl with disabilities, I require daily help to get by. In my teens I stumbled by a small list from a man named Bill Wall. I Matty Angel took this list and in my early teens expanded on it as much as I could. Going so far as talking to certain people involved by email. Creating a Timeline of Early Hacking. 

I called Myself a Net Angel, a term given to me by one of the hackers I spoke to mentioned in this list, I wish to give to all of you my life's work. I share this hoping that perhaps one day others can add to it beyond what I was able to do.
